// 3. what an interpreter is and how it differs from a compiler. Provide examples of programming languages that use interpreters and those that use compilers.
// ==> * diffrent Between interpreter and compiler :
//         => interpreter Translates program one statement at a time.

//         => compiler Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.

//         => Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers.

//         => Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.

        //    => In Interpreters Errors are displayed in every single line.

        //    => In Compiler Errors are displayed in Compiler after Compiling together at the current time.


// ==> * examples of programming languages that use interpreters and those that use compilers :

//         => interpreter use Programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby use interpreters.

//         => compiler use Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.
