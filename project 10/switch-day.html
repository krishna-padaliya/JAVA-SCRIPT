<!-- **Question 1:**

**Title:** Day of the Week

**Description:** Write a JavaScript program that uses a `switch-case` statement to check the value of a variable `day`. Depending on the value of `day`, display the following messages:
- If `day` is "Monday", console.log("It's the start of the workweek.").
- If `day` is "Friday", console.log("It's almost the weekend!").
- For any other value of `day`, console.log("It's some other day."). -->
