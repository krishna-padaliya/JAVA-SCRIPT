<!-- **Question:**You are building a simple music player application. You have a base 
    class called `Instrument` with a method `playSound()`. Create two subclasses, `Guitar` 
    and `Piano`, both inheriting from the `Instrument` class.

In the `Guitar` class, override the `playSound()` method to print "Strumming the guitar 
strings" to the console. In the `Piano` class, override the `playSound()` method to print 
"Pressing the piano keys" to the console.

Create an array of `Instrument` objects, including instances of both `Guitar` and `Piano`. 
Iterate through the array and call the `playSound()` method for each object. -->
