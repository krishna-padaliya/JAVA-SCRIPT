representing products in the store. The `Product` class has properties `name` and `price`. 
Create a new class called `DiscountedProduct` that inherits from the `Product` class. 
The `DiscountedProduct` class should have an additional property called `discountPercentage` 
representing the discount percentage on the product. Implement a method called 
`calculateDiscountedPrice()` in the `DiscountedProduct` class that calculates and returns
 the discounted price based on the original price and the discount percentage. Create an 
 instance of `DiscountedProduct` with a name, price, and discount percentage, and then 
 call the `calculateDiscountedPrice()` method to get the final discounted price. -->
