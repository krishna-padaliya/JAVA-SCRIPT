<!-- **Question2:**Create a class hierarchy for vehicles. Implement a base class `Vehicle` with properties `brand` and `color`. Define a method `startEngine()` in the `Vehicle` class, which outputs a message indicating that the engine has started.

Create two derived classes: `Car` and `Motorcycle`. The `Car` class should inherit from the `Vehicle` class and have an additional property `numDoors` (number of doors in the car). Override the `startEngine()` method in the `Car` class to output a car-specific message about starting the engine.

The `Motorcycle` class should also inherit from the `Vehicle` class and have an additional property `hasSidecar` (a boolean indicating whether the motorcycle has a sidecar). Override the `startEngine()` method in the `Motorcycle` class to output a motorcycle-specific message about starting the engine.

Create instances of the `Car` and `Motorcycle` classes, demonstrate how they inherit properties from the `Vehicle` class, and call their respective `startEngine()` methods to display their specific messages. -->
