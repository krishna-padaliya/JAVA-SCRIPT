<!-- **Question1:**Implement a class hierarchy for animals. Create a base class `Animal` with 
    properties `name` and `type` representing the name of the animal and its type 
    (e.g., mammal, reptile). Define a method `makeSound()` in the `Animal` class, which 
    outputs a generic animal sound.
Create two derived classes: `Bird` and `Fish`. The `Bird` class should inherit from the 
`Animal` class and have an additional property `canFly` (a boolean indicating whether the 
bird can fly). Override the `makeSound()` method in the `Bird` class to output a bird-specific
 sound.

The `Fish` class should also inherit from the `Animal` class and have an additional property 
`habitat` (e.g., freshwater, saltwater). Override the `makeSound()` method in the `Fish` class 
to output a fish-specific sound.

Create instances of the `Bird` and `Fish` classes, demonstrate how they inherit properties
 from the `Animal` class, and call their respective `makeSound()` methods to display their
  specific sounds.

Certainly! Here's another question that builds upon the previous example: -->
