<!-- **Question Prompt:**

Write a JavaScript program to handle reception logic. Prompt the user to enter the number of 
guests attending the reception. Implement the following logic:

- If the number of guests is 0, print in the console: "It seems like no one is attending the 
reception. Are you sure?"
- If the number of guests is 1, print: "Great! There is one guest attending the reception."
- If the number of guests is 2, print: "Perfect! You and one other person will be attending
 the reception."
- If the number of guests is more than 2, print the number of guests and "guests will be 
attending the reception."
- If the input is invalid (not a number or negative number), print: "Invalid input. Please 
enter a valid number of guests."

After determining the number of guests, run a loop for the number of guests present and print: 
"Thank you, guest #[guestNumber], for attending the reception!" During this loop,
 skip thanking guests if their number is 3.

Finally, regardless of the number of guests, print: "Reception logic executed successfully." -->
