<!-- **Question:**Imagine you have an array of objects representing books in a library. Each object has the following properties: `title` (the title of the book), `author` (the author's name), and `year` (the year the book was published).



Write a JavaScript function to find and return the titles of all books in the library that were published before a 2000 . The function should take the `library` array and a `year` as parameters and return an array of book titles that meet the condition. -->
