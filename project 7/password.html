<!-- **Question1:**
1. You are provided with three variables:
   - `cpw` (current password): This variable holds the current password.
   - `stpw` (stored password): This variable holds the stored password.
   - `newpw` (new password): This variable holds the new password the user wants to set.

2. Check if the `cpw` (current password) matches the `stpw` (stored password). If they match:
   - Check if the `newpw` (new password) has a length less than or equal to 8 characters.
     - If the length is less than or equal to 8 characters, update the `stpw` (stored password) with the `newpw` (new password) and print "short length."
     - If the length is greater than 8 characters, print "correct pwd."
   - If the `cpw` (current password) doesn't match the `stpw` (stored password), print "incorrect password." -->
